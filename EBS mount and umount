creating the volume
   create the volume under the ebs,add the volume  accrdng to reqirment and the attach to the instance
        lsblk ( to get all info mounted instances) in terminal
        file -s /dev/xvdf  (info about file system)
        file -s /dev/xvda  (info about file system)
         mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf ( make file file system ) after creating file sysytem ,need to mount 
         to mount we need to create directory
         mkdir ebsvolume
         check with ls command
         mount the new added storage
         mount /dev/xvdf ebsvolume
       now we can create the file in the ebsvolume
       umount /dev/xvdf
       
       we can modify the volume in the instance ,we only increase the volume cannot decrease the storage
       after modifying ,check in the terminal throgh lsblk
       df -h to check in tne operating system weather it is resized or not.
       
       resize2fs /dev/xvdf
